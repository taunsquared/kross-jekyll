NeuroGEARS is a creative research group bridging Neuroscience, Games, Interaction, and Robotics. We engage with top research and academic institutions worldwide to reimagine science by using and creating open-source tools which are accessible, understandable and modifiable. Our core mission is to make scientific knowledge available to everyone, and to empower people to follow their curiosity, wherever it may lead.

We want people to be able to take apart their tools to understand how they work, so that anyone can quickly recombine and repurpose technology. To do this we imagine, create, and teach technology, using storytelling and interactive experiences, and helping people to apply scientific methods of understanding to their daily lives.

We are a network of explorers who believe in asking profound questions by engaging in responsible, inventive, and rigorous research that also incorporates humour, sass, and deep fun. To this end we bring an extensive background in building virtual and augmented reality systems, interactive installations, autonomous robots, performing arts, and neuroscience research.
