NeuroGEARS has joined an international consortium of partners working on the project "eMOTIONAL Cities - Mapping the cities through the senses of those who make them". 

Understanding the interaction between people and urban spaces is key to finding ways to enhance citizens' health. In particular, the signals generated in our neurobiological architecture, which controls ours emotions and decisions, during this interaction may provide invaluable insights. The EU-funded eMOTIONAL Cities project will characterise the urban health challenges and inequalities. Its work will lead to innovative eMOTIONAL city mapping that will be produced from spatial analysis on social and health data and neuroscience experiments. To do this, the project will draw on urban planning and design, neuroscience, and data science and technology.

This research is developed under the eMOTIONAL CITIES' Project, which received funding from European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under the grant agreement No 945307. The eMOTIONAL CITIES Project is a consortium of 12 partners co-coordinated by IGOT and FMUL, taking place between 2021 and 2025. More information at https://emotionalcities-h2020.eu/.
